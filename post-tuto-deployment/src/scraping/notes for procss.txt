started making the contents of the ml folder. learned some more about convoluteions and backpropagation and how they determine slope using the weight and the value.
for next day, wrap up the contents of the ml folder, and set up the function imports

3/19
need to create the contents of the ml folder, get the imports set up

3/18
relu rectified linear unit, helps the algorythm perform better
brings negative outputs to a 0 angle, positive outputs output their same value

pooling chooses how you simplify the image, maxpooling brings out the greatest value, average pooling brings out the average

conv1d just convolves in 1d, conv2d concolves in  dimensions


3/17
got the images, csv and assets folders done for dash


3/1 
need to install: flask, dash, gunicorn, Docker and Docker Compose, peewee, config, db, wget, torch (honestly just look at the requirements.txt)

for api
##think done - need to create the contents of the ml folder, as well as add the model you want to use
##think done - need to set up the function import for the predict_sentiment and CharacterLevelCNN functions

for dash
## done - need to create the contents of the assets, csv and images folders 

for docker
need to learn how docker setup works, and add the docker file, the config file, and the requirements.txt for each of the folders


2/13
need to understand the @app.route and method thing in Flask
https://www.toptal.com/python/python-machine-learning-flask-example


2/10
Flask==1.1.1
peewee==3.11.2
tqdm==4.31.1
torch==1.3.0
psycopg2-binary==2.8.4
gunicorn==19.9.0
wget==3.2

2/4
dropout in neural networks
relu in neural networks

python train.py --data_path C:\Users\isaama2\Projects\post-tuto-deployment\src\scraping\scrapy\comments_trustpilot.csv --validation_split 0.1 --label_column rating --text_column comment --max_length 1014 --dropout_input 0 --group_labels 1 --balance 1 --ignore_center 0 --model_name en_trustpilot --log_every 250

1/28
need to install a compatable version of torch

1/23/20

Need to create the post_tuto_deployment directory
need to set up the ML system as they have it


1/22/20

Need to bring my entire base Anaconda install up to the latest packages. (Everything may already be up to date.)

conda update conda

conda update anaconda

conda update python

conda update --all

conda update -n base -c defaults conda

conda install -c pytorch pytorch=0.4.1

##need to install the correct version of pytorch (0.4.1)
need to install the correct version of Tensorflow (2.0.0)
need to install the correct version of tensorboard (1.8

"It doesn’t matter which version are you using in terms of compatibility as long as if you have GPU and your GPU is among the supported type of GPUs. 
Tensorflow is depending on CUDA version while CUDA is depending on your GPU type and GPU card driver version. You must consider the following two Keypoints:"

Also should I install GIT while I am at it?

Need visual studio for CUDA - maybe not with Anaconda

Need to figure out which version of CUDA I need to install. - not necessary with Anaconda?
	"If you have a GPU it doesn't matter any version of cuda you use"
	Cuda Install Guide - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/

Need to use that version of CUDA to dictate which wheel of PyTorch 0.4.1 I install. - Also instlaling PyTorch with Anaconda?
	I think I can install - cu92/torch-0.4.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

Apparently using Anaconda simplifies PyTorch installation?
	With anaconda python you do not have to install CUDA.
	Read up on conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/

Tensorflow 2.0.0 (optional, useful for model monitoring)
	https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
	One suggestion: 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54239122/tensorflow-python-3-7
	"Firstly, you should download and set up the anaconda via anaconda and then open anaconda prompt and then follow these steps via TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?lang=python3
	Fourthly, you should use 'pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow==1.14.0' to install TensorFlow 1.14 on Conda Finally, you can use TensorFlow that is version 1.14 on python 3.7"
	
	Tensorflow Requires:
	NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® Compute Capability 3.5 or higher. See the list of CUDA-enabled GPU cards. - We are set on this
	-	Video Card: Quadro M620 
	-	Compute Capability: 5.2
	
TensorboardX 1.8 (optional, useful for model monitoring)


Oh most excellent! 

Your guide came up while I am researching my first PyTorch, TensorFlow and and TensorboardX installation. You laid out such a detailed explanation of the process of installing TensorFlow, and cleared up many questions I had about installing PyTorch like what CUDA do I need, and what Visual Studio do I need. (Turns out neither with a fresh Anaconda install)

I'm following this tutorial: https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/blog/end-to-end-machine-learning which requires PyTorch 0.4.1 and suggests TensorboardX 1.8, both of which are outdated versions. If I follow your Install TensorFlow 2 beta1 (GPU) guide on top of your How to Install TensorFlow with GPU Support on Windows 10 guide, will installation of these older versions go smoothly? Assuming I use some install instructions like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50229857/how-can-i-downgrade-the-version-pytorch-from-0-4-to-0-31-with-anaconda
