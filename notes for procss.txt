"It doesn’t matter which version are you using in terms of compatibility as long as if you have GPU and your GPU is among the supported type of GPUs. 
Tensorflow is depending on CUDA version while CUDA is depending on your GPU type and GPU card driver version. You must consider the following two Keypoints:"

Also should I install GIT while I am at it?

Need visual studio for CUDA - maybe not with Anaconda

Need to figure out which version of CUDA I need to install. - not necessary with Anaconda?
	"If you have a GPU it doesn't matter any version of cuda you use"
	Cuda Install Guide - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/

Need to use that version of CUDA to dictate which wheel of PyTorch 0.4.1 I install. - Also instlaling PyTorch with Anaconda?
	I think I can install - cu92/torch-0.4.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

Apparently using Anaconda simplifies PyTorch installation?
	With anaconda python you do not have to install CUDA.
	Read up on conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/

Tensorflow 2.0.0 (optional, useful for model monitoring)
	https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
	One suggestion: 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54239122/tensorflow-python-3-7
	"Firstly, you should download and set up the anaconda via anaconda and then open anaconda prompt and then follow these steps via TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?lang=python3
	Fourthly, you should use 'pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow==1.14.0' to install TensorFlow 1.14 on Conda Finally, you can use TensorFlow that is version 1.14 on python 3.7"
	
	Tensorflow Requires:
	NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® Compute Capability 3.5 or higher. See the list of CUDA-enabled GPU cards. - We are set on this
	-	Video Card: Quadro M620 
	-	Compute Capability: 5.2
	
TensorboardX 1.8 (optional, useful for model monitoring)


Oh most excellent! 

Your guide came up while I am researching my first PyTorch, TensorFlow and and TensorboardX installation. You laid out such a detailed explanation of the process of installing TensorFlow, and cleared up many questions I had about installing PyTorch like what CUDA do I need, and what Visual Studio do I need. (Turns out neither with a fresh Anaconda install)

I'm following this tutorial: https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/blog/end-to-end-machine-learning which requires PyTorch 0.4.1 and suggests TensorboardX 1.8, both of which are outdated versions. If I follow your Install TensorFlow 2 beta1 (GPU) guide on top of your How to Install TensorFlow with GPU Support on Windows 10 guide, will installation of these older versions go smoothly? Assuming I use some install instructions like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50229857/how-can-i-downgrade-the-version-pytorch-from-0-4-to-0-31-with-anaconda
