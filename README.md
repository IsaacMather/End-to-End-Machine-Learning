# End-to-End-Machine-Learning

This is a demonstration of ability I completed in early 2020! 

It is an end to end project, from scraping data to training the ML model, and then setting up an API, front end and back end with Flask, Dash, and Peewee. 

It is deployed to production inside of a Docker container on Google Cloud. You can see the live product at isaacmather.com! (give it a second sometimes it takes awhile to load!)

Cheers!
Isaac
